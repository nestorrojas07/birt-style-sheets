The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can be used to add themes and styles to your rich information visualizations. Style Sheets can easily be integrated with your report document by either linking the CSS file, or by importing the styles from a style sheet into your designs. Not only will adding skins to your reports help highlight the key attributes of your data but also will provide for a more consistent document.
